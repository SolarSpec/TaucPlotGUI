Description:
	ARESLab is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for building piecewise-linear
	and piecewise-cubic regression models using the Multivariate
	Adaptive Regression Splines method (also known as MARS).
	The source code is tested under Matlab version 8.6 (R2015b) and
	Octave version 4.0.0.

Installation (for Matlab):
	Start Matlab and select "Set path..." from the File menu. Click
	"Add with subfolders" button and select the ARESLab folder in the
	file dialog. Press the Save button in order to save your changes
	to the Matlab search path. The toolbox is now installed. Have fun.
